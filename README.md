# Sparkify-Capstone-Project
Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Capstone Project

## Installation
The version of Python and the modules used in the analysis are the following:

* python: 3.*
* pyspark: 2.4.3
* numpy: 1.12.1
* pandas: 0.23.3

## Project Motivation
The aim of the analysis is to be able to understand and predict the behaviour a user does on a web when he deciding to cancel his subscription. In order to achieve this task, exploratory analysis, visualization tools and machine learning techniques will be implemented in order to gain insights form the data.


## Dataset Description
The dataset used for the analysis is a web log from the music app Sparkify. This dataset contains 286500 user logs with 18 columns where user information (name, surname, gender, location), usage of the web (pages user visits, songs played with its correspondent artist, number of session) and user suscription plan (free, paid)  have been collected.

## Files Description
The files contained in the project are the following:

* mini_sparkify_event_data.json: The dataset used for the analysis.
* Sparkify.ipynb: The notebook containing all the analysis.

## Licensing
The dataset used for the analysis belongs to Udacity.
